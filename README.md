# learnnode

repo for my solutions to tutorial exercises at https://nodeschool.io

## Core

### learnyounode
Informative exercises. Got me started on node.js, which I have no background of.

### javascripting
Too elementary; I'd already been programming js for a long time now - so not useful for me. 

### how-to-npm
This tutorial is also very elementary but informative.

### scope-chains-closures
Again a simple lesson, not much detail.

### elementrary-electron
Simple tutorial, shows initial setup of electron and simple examples.
The print to pdf (last exercise) did not work on my fedora notebook.

### stream-adventure
The first tutorial with a few challenges and a lot to learn. I also had
to peek at the solution to the last one because I was struggling for a
long time with it.

### how-to-markdown
Elementary stuff, I got to use some GFM specific syntax for the first time.
Still very useful.

## Electives

### functional-javascript-workshop
Interesting totorial. Learnt call, bind and Function object.

### js-best-practices
Not too much content here except some separation of concerns and a few 
code improvements. (not deep)
